# Cancellation-Trend-in-Hotel-Bookings
Booking cancellation is a major challenge for hotel managers. We already know by now that, Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions to travel plans. Hotel industry has been overwhelmed by large number of cancellations. Due to the growing popularity of online travel agents such as Booking.com, Expedia and Co. it is becoming more and more common to do free cancellations up to 24 hours before arrival. Although, this brings a new dimension of flexibility to hotel guests, but, it has also increased financial risk for hotels and difficulties to plan their occupancy rate. Thus, realizing the importance to analyse cancellation behavior of hotel guests we are working on hotels data to predict risk of cancellation on future bookings.
